%% Description
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function calculates the temperature response for a POD system
%
%                     T(x,t) ≈ Σ φ_i(x) * a_i(t)   
%
% where x is the spatial position, t is the time, φ are the spatial modes,
% and a(t) are the temporal modes based on a PDE system with matrices Gth 
% and Cth as extracted from the POD training.
